# Project Name
ParkBuddy

# Description
Driving in urban areas can be stressful, but sometimes the most time-consuming part isn't the traffic itself, but looking for parking. ParkBuddy utilizes sensors and a mobile app to help find available parking spaces in crowded areas, alleviating the inconvenience of searching for parking while also cutting down on traffic and time traveled.

# Primary user base
ParkBuddy aims to cater to average people who live in urban areas around the country, from those who have a preference of traveling by car, to those who live in cities with underdeveloped public transportation and only have the option of getting around by car.
